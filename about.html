                <p>Response Ready AI didn't start in a boardroom; it started by watching hard-working people lose business because they were doing the actual work.</p>
                
                <p>I saw HVAC pros and local contractors spending their days in crawlspaces and on ladders, only to check their phones at 6:00 PM and find three missed calls from new customers. By then, those customers had already called the next guy on Google.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I built Sam to fix that.</strong></p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>We provide a "Response Ready" front desk for small businesses. We aren't interested in tech for tech’s sake. We build AI assistants that sound human, understand the technical details of your trade, and book your calendar so you can stay focused on the job.</p>
