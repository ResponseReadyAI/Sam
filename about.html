            <div class="bio-section">
                <p>I started Response Ready AI because I was tired of time after time not getting through to make an appointment I needed for a leaky roof. I called around. I waited for a few days. I dumped out a bucket a few times.</p>
                
                <p>By the time the first guy got back to me, I'd already gone with a different one - simply becasue they had actually picked up the phone.</p>

                <p>I realized that the ones who hadn't picked up weren't ignoring me. They didn't think they were too good for a new customer. They were busy working and just weren't able to answer my call.</p>
                
                <p><strong>I built Sam to fix that.</strong></p>

                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>We provide a "Response Ready" front desk for small businesses. We aren't interested in tech for tech’s sake. Whether you're heating someone's home or saving an outgrown hairstyle, Sam will take every call and book your calendar so you can stay focused on the job.</p>
