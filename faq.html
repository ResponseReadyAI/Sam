                    <h4>Who is Sam for?</h4>
                    <p>Sam's job is to answer the phone, book appointments, handle intake, and transfer calls when necessary. If the success of your business depends on a thriving customer base, Sam is for you!</p>
              
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Does Sam sound like a robot?</h4>
                    <p>We’ll be honest: nothing beats a real human connection. While Sam is an AI, she provides a professional, helpful experience that ensures your customers feel heard rather than ignored.  That's a far cry from the frustrating "press 1 for sales" menus of the past.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How does the calendar booking work?</h4>
                    <p>Sam integrates directly with your Outlook or Google Calendar via Cal.com. You set your availability, and Sam only offers slots that are actually open. You’ll get an instant notification the second a job is booked.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What if it's a call I need to take?</h4>
                    <p>We can customize Sam to identify keywords or even your name. Same day cancellation? Emergency situation? Sam can be set to immediately route the caller to your cell phone or a designated technician.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Do I have to change my phone number?</h4>
                    <p>Nope. You can keep your existing business line. We simply set up conditional call forwarding so that if you don't answer within two rings, the call seamlessly rolls over to Sam.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is my data secure?</h4>
                    <p>Absolutely. We use enterprise-grade encryption for all integrations. Your customer data and calendar details are never shared or used for anything other than managing your bookings.</p>
